# Modern PHP

This is the companion code repository for [Modern PHP](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033868.do) by Josh Lockhart (O’Reilly).

## About the Book

The PHP language is different than you remember. No longer just about procedural code and monolithic frameworks, PHP has experienced a renaissance to become a full-featured, mature language with object-orientation, namespaces, and a growing collection of reusable component libraries.

Modern PHP reveals these new language features in action. Author Josh Lockhart—creator of [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/), a popular community initiative—shows you how to develop PHP applications using best practices for application architecture and planning, databases, security, testing, debugging, and deployment.

* Learn detailed, practical techniques that you can immediately implement in your PHP project
* Grow your PHP skillset with the newest language features and modern best practices
* Get up to speed on new language features of PHP 5.x (OOP, DateTime, namespaces, traits, and more)
* Discover the latest from the PHP community, including what's new with the Hack programming language and the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM)
* Find out how the new PHP has become a more mature language with community standards, a growing affinity for interoperable components, and a passionate community committed to improving performance.

## About this Repository

Each chapter has its own repository directory, and directory contents are organized according to the chapter's content. I've tried to name each code file according to its related Figure ID in the book.
